# Hostinger Email Integration Setup

## Required SMTP Credentials

To complete the email integration, please provide your Hostinger SMTP settings:

### SMTP Configuration Needed:
- **SMTP Server**: (e.g., smtp.hostinger.com)
- **SMTP Port**: (usually 587 for TLS or 465 for SSL)
- **Email Address**: (e.g., contact@your-domain.com)
- **Email Password**: (your email account password)
- **Security Type**: (TLS/SSL)

### How to Find Your Hostinger SMTP Settings:
1. Log into your Hostinger control panel
2. Go to "Email" section
3. Select your email account
4. Look for "Mail Client Configuration" or "SMTP Settings"

### Example Configuration:
```
SMTP Server: smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP Port: 587

```

Once you provide these credentials, I'll configure the system to use your Hostinger email for:
